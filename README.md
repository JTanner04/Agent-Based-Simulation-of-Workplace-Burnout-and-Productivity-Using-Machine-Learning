# Agent-Based Simulation of Workplace Burnout & Productivity

**Project Title:**
Agent-Based Simulation of Workplace Burnout and Productivity Using Machine Learning

**Current Status:**
- Completed: Sprint 1 (Core Simulation MVP)
- In Progress: Sprint 2 (Behavioral Complexity + UI MVP)

---

## Project Concept

We simulate a dynamic workplace where employee agents possess roles, workloads, personalities, stress thresholds, and coping strategies. The goal is to evaluate how different organizational structures, workloads, and mental health interventions affect overall productivity, morale, and burnout rates.

## Technical Architecture & Tech Stack

1. **Core Simulation (Backend)**
   - Language: Python
   - Framework: Mesa (Agent-Based Modeling)
   - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy

2. **Frontend & Visualization**
   - Framework: Streamlit
   - Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly

3. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - ML: scikit-learn, PyTorch
   - Reinforcement Learning: Stable-Baselines3

4. **Data Storage & Processing**
   - Database: PostgreSQL (using psycopg2)
   - Data Handling: Pandas, CSV/JSON exports

5. **API Layer (Optional)**
   - Framework: FastAPI

6. **Deployment & DevOps**
   - Containerization: Docker
   - Hosting: Heroku (MVP), Hugging Face Spaces (Streamlit), AWS EC2 (scale)
   - CI/CD: GitHub Actions

7. **Optional Enhancements**
   - PDF Reports: PDFKit
   - Advanced Visualization: Bokeh
   - AI Plugins: OpenAI, LangChain

## Deployment Recommendations

- **MVP:** Deploy backend & Streamlit app to Heroku or Hugging Face Spaces for rapid feedback.  
- **Scalability:** Containerize with Docker and host on AWS EC2.  
- **Persistence:** Use a managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., Heroku Postgres or AWS RDS) for simulation run history.

### Sprint 1: Core Simulation MVP (Jun 19 – Jun 30)
- **Backend Lead:** Set up Mesa framework, implement `EmployeeAgent` and `ManagerAgent`, define stress→burnout rules, export to CSV/JSON, persist runs to PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend:** Scaffold Streamlit app, add basic start/stop and team-size controls, plot simple line charts.
- **ML Analyst:** Run initial EDA, define burnout labels, prepare data for modeling.

### Sprint 2: Behavioral Complexity + UI MVP (Jul 1 – Jul 12)
- **Backend Lead:** Introduce personality traits (e.g., resilience), recovery mechanics (breaks, PTO), and inter-agent interactions.
- **Frontend:** Build state visualization table, add toggles for HR policies, integrate run-save/load from PostgreSQL, enhance charts with Plotly.
- **ML Analyst:** Train initial burnout classifier, export daily risk snapshots, visualize results.
